* Evil-lispops
operations for editing lisp evilly

#+HTML: <img src=".assets/emacslisp.png" align="center">

This package is currently in *ALPHA* status.  It mostly works, but has rough edges.

** Compatibility
This *should* work with old versions of evil.

The mode map =evil-lispops-mode-map= uses the ~<~ and ~>~ keys.  The =evil-shift-left= and =right= keys are moved to =<<= and =>>= respectively when the mode is active.

** Install
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package evil-lispops
  :after evil
  :hook (emacs-lisp-mode . evil-lispops-mode)
  :config
  (evil-lispops-setup))
#+END_SRC

** Tentative layout:
